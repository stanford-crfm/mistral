# gpt2-intensive-config.yaml
#   Intensive Benchmarking GPT-2 Config, currently working with the OpenWebText Dataset, GPT-2 Small Architecture, and
#   full batch size (512). Support for Multi-Node Mixed Precision runs, for final round of benchmarking of DDP,
#   FairScale, and DeepSpeed.
#
#   Inheritance and core paths can all be overridden from the command line or by re-writing these files.
