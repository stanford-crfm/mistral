# gpt2-scaling-config.yaml
#   GPT-2 Scaling Config for benchmarking memory footprint and training time for various GPT-2 Architectures, working
#   with the WikiText-103 Dataset (assuming data loading doesn't affect GPU Memory), sequence length of 1024,
#   and full batch size (512).
#
#   Inheritance and core paths can all be overridden from the command line or by re-writing these files.
